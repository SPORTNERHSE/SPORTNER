              "       'Тридцатого марта ожидается внушительная порция матчей регулярного немецкого первенства. Нашим аналитикам в данной статье хотелось бы остановиться на противостоянии Лейпцига против Герты. Событие стартует в полдевятого вечера по московскому времени на стадионе «Ред Булл Арена». Весьма интригующее противостояние, ибо в гости к третьей команде приедет крепкий середняк. Разумеется, в данной ситуации «быки» котируются явными фаворитами. С подобной ситуацией даже спорит сложно – хозяева отлично выступают при родных трибунах, а у гостей частенько возникают проблемы на выезде. Единственная преграда для азартной стороны планеты – не шибко комфортный коэффициент, который залетит только в экспрессе. Давайте попытаемся найти выгодный вариант и для одиноких воинов. Ребята уходили на весенний перерыв в положительном настроении. В пяти последних официальных баталиях значится три победы при двух мировых. Самый свежий матч приключился 16-го марта, когда «быки» поехали в гости к Шальке. Наши сегодняшние герои распечатали ворота уже на четырнадцатой минуте. Все остальное время на поляне творилась сплошная борьба, которая больше не вылилась в забитые голы. 21-го числа коллектив провел товарищеский матч против польской команды Погонь Щецин – поражение со счетом 3:5. Ту баталию можно даже не воспринимать всерьез. Накануне двадцать седьмого тура команда собрала сорок девять баллов. Столь уверенный показатель равняется третьей позиции в турнирной таблице немецкого первенства. На домашней арене значится семь побед при пяти мировых и одном лузе. «Крестьяне» не могу похвастаться приличными результатами. В пяти последних битвах ребята трижды проиграли при одной победе над Майнцом и мировой с Вердером. Самый крайний матч датируется 16-м числом. В указанный день Герта принимала на родной арене Боруссию. Наши сегодняшние герои дважды выходили вперед, но наглые «шмели» не просто отыгрывались, а еще и вырвали победу на 92-й минуте. Вот с такими печальными показателями подходят ребята к будущему туру. Сейчас можно завести разговор о турнирном положении гостей. Накануне двадцать седьмого тура ребята собрали тридцать пять баллов. Показатель соответствует десятой позиции в турнирной таблице Бундеслиги. О европейском будущем можно мечтать. В гостях команда сыграла тринадцать матчей, в четырех из которых значится победа. Хозяева на родной арене редко сеют очки. Гости же на выезде проигрывают ровно в половине случаев. В подобной ситуации хотелось бы зарядить ставку на хозяев.',\n",
              "       'Встречаются лидеры второй лиги и одна из лучших линий обороны с одной из самых мощных линий атаки Бундес2. На кону полуфинал Кубка страны и нас ждет аккуратная игра от обороны и главная ставка команд на ошибку соперника. «Падерборн» после 27 туров турнира второй лиги Германии сумел добыть 44 балла и вплотную приблизился к лидирующей тройке. Отрыв от третьего «Унион Берлин» составляет три очка и в последнем туре «черно-синие» переиграли «железный союз» на их поле со счетом 3:1. Всего в активе Штеффена Баумгарта 12 побед и восемь мировых. Свой путь в 1/4 финала Кубка Германии хозяева прошли через победы над «Ингольштадт» (2:1), «Chemie Leipzig» (3:0) и «Дуйсбург» (3:1). «Гамбург» расположился на втором месте в турнирной таблице и после 27 туров добыл 15 побед и шесть ничьих. «Динозавры» на четыре очка опережают третий «Унион Берлин» и на три пункта отстают от первого «Кёльна» и можно сделать прогноз, что «черно-бело-синие» не упустят свою путевку в высшую лигу. В последнем туре «горожане» сыграли вничью с «Бохумом» (0:0). На пути в 1/4 финала подопечные Ханнеса Вольфа выбили «Эрндтебрюк» (5:3), «Вехен» (3:0) и «Нюрнберг» (1:0).',\n",

Последние 5 встреч на выезде : 14 пропустили и 2 забили, сегодня игра против Дерри Сити, команда лучше среднего уровня, дома играет хорошо, в очных встречах редко пропускала от такой слабой команды, сегодня хозяева выйграют в сухую и без проблем, много голов не жду, поэтому ставка должна заходить',\n",
              "       'Црвена Звезда - \"Янг Бойз\". По кадровому потенциалу команды примерно равны. В 56.95 млн. € и 66.45 млн. € соответственно оцениваются их составы. В первом матче \"пчелы\" были более активны. Но постоянный прессинг (владение мячом 69-31) и обильные попытки поразить ворота соперника (26 (в створ 7) - 8 (в створ 2)) дивидендов не принесли и команде Герардо Сеоане пришлось даже отыгрываться. В ответном матче отстоять статус-кво будет не просто, учитывая силу визави в родных пенатах. Гости будут идти вперед и в ответном матче постараются быть более бдительными к контрвыпадам \"звездашей\". \"Црвена Звезда\". Повторив результат позапрошлого сезона «звездаши» подчеркнули оптимальность формы команды и отсутствие конкуренции на локальной арене. Команда Владана Милоевича два сезона к ряду имела показатель результативности за матч в районе трех мячей, но вот на старте текущего сезона «красно-белые» не впечатляют эффективностью в атаке, по результатам одиннадцати официальных матчей имея голевой показатель 18:9. «Белградцы» под началом Владана Милоевича проиграли всего три матча в родных стенах (\"Арсеналу\" (0:1) в сезоне 2017/18, а так же ПСЖ (1:4) и \"Партизану\" (0:1) в прошлом) и на этом фоне недооценивать их не стоит. \"Янг Бойз\". С начала текущего десятилетия \"Базель\" установил чемпионскую гегемонию в швейцарской Суперлиге. Ади Хюттер, обеспечивший триумф \"желто-черным\", по итогам сезона 2017/18 перебрался в Бундеслигу, а его дело уверенно продолжил Герардо Сеоане, опередив \"Базель\" аж на двадцать очков. В летнее межсезонье удалось сохранить ключевых игроков стартовой обоймы, а за счет продажи Кевина Мбабу и Джибриля Соу удалось не просто пополнить бюджет на 18 млн. €, но и подписать пол дюжины игроков. \"Пчелы\" уверенно начали сезон и наверняка приложат максимум усилий, чтобы пробиться в следующий раунд соревнований. Рискованный прогноз - Янг Бойз победит (коэфф. - 2.85 от betcity)',\n",
              "       'Япония — Тринидад и Тобаго: прогноз и ставка на матч 5 июня 2019 года. Товарищеский матч начнется в 13:30 на «Тойота Стэдиум» (Аичи). Статистика личных встреч, обзор матча, составы команд и коэффициенты букмекеров.Япония Япония сейчас возвращает себе славу одного из лидеров азиатского футбола. На последнем Кубке Азии, зимой, «синие самураи» уверенно шли до финала, выиграв все 6 матчей, но в решающем поединке сенсационно уступили Катару. Тем не менее, Хадзиме Мориясу сохранил пост главного тренера, и сейчас готовит своих подопечных к Копа Америка — южноамериканцы снова позвали японцев на свой континентальный турнир. Впрочем, нынешний состав имеет минимум отношения к той, что была еще в феврале. Как и Лев на Кубке Конфедерации-2017, Мориясу решил повезти на следующий турнир де-факто команду дебютантов, разбавленную голкипером Кавасимой, хавбеком Сибасаки и Синдзи Окадзаки из «Лестера». Помимо них, только у 2 защитников, Уэды и Томиясу, есть опыт игры на уровне сборных. Но с Боливией 26 мая сыграли и такие звезды, как Рицу Доан, Усами и Инуи — они получат возможность отдыхать позже.Тринидад и Тобаго Тринидад и Тобаго только раз, под руководством легендарного Лео Беенхакера, смог пробиться на чемпионат мира. Тогда у «воинов Сока» были такие сильные игроки, как Летейпи и, главное, Дуайт Йорк. Сейчас же под руками у Денниса Лоуренса, кстати, в прошлом футболиста того золотого поколения, более слабые исполнители. И не удивительно, что тринидадцы трижды кряду даже в товарищеских поединках, причем далеко не грандам — не только Уэльсу, но и Ирану, и даже Таиланду. Сейчас, ради товарищеских матчей, не получилось собрать оптимальный состав. Не сыграет в июньских поединках самый опытный голкипер, Жан-Мишель Уильямс (88 игр, в топ-10 за всю историю), а также защитники Давид и Батю, хавбеки Джонс, Молино и Гуэрра. Не приехал и самый результативный бомбардир нынешнего состава, Уиллис Пласа. Кстати, 31-летний нападающий сейчас играет в чемпионате Бангладеша. Травмы и дисквалификации — японцы из-за повреждений не смогли вызвать полузащитников Эндо, Аояму, Ошиму и нападающего Юму Судзуки. Факты о матче. Это вторая встреча между сборными. В 2006-м «золотой» вариант сборной Тринидада и Тобаго без вариантов уступил японцам со счетом 0-2.Коэффициенты на матч Букмекерская контора Пари-Матч считает, что «синие самураи» получат очень удобного соперника, с которым можно наладить взаимодействие сборной, у которой будет много новичков и дебютантов. На Японию можно ставить под 1,23, при 14,5 на Тринидад и 5,8 на ничью. При таком разнице в силах команд ожидаемо невысок коэффициент на «тотал больше 2,5» — всего лишь 1,79.Прогноз и ставка от BetOn Япония против Боливии показала, что хочет выигрывать, но вряд ли для этого будет рвать жилы. Тринидад, который ради этой игры пролетит чуть ли не пол мира, вряд ли будет особенно сопротивляться.Эта ставка пройдет? да нет Poll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser. да 73%, 74 голоса 74 голоса 73%74 голоса - 73% из всех голосовнет 27%, 27 голосов 27 голосов 27%27 голосов - 27% из всех голосовКоличество голосов: 101 28.05.2019× Вы или с вашего IP уже голосовали. да нет × Вы или с вашего IP уже голосовали.'],\n",

I had £16 on to win just over £400. During this time the cash out was completely suspended.  As an experiment I put £10 on BATE not to score and was constatnly offered a cash out so there was definitely nothing suspended on that match and all my other teams had green 'won' ticks besides them.  I asked what was the reason for no cash out on live chat and was just repetitively given some generic rubbish answer, the best being there was no value in a cash out.  No value?! 6 games won and the favourite left to score 1 goal in 20 mins and extra time!  I think it's obvious to everyone reading this why they didn't want to offer a cash out.

But this doesn't seem to be the case with Bet365 and a 'reasonable' bet to a small stake goes unhindered.I have had reason to deal with their Customer Services a couple of times. The telephonist on the first call was able to answer my query - the second was unable to do so but got their 'manager' on the line who explained their procedure clearly with regard to forecasts and the 'best prices' they offer on them.While it's true that the Rules should deal with these matters, there are always going to be unrealised scenarios. The difference between this Company and the other couple I've dealt with, however, is that they find the answer and don't hide behind either silence or invention.I refused to take up their Introductory Offer as it seemed too much like a promotion to gamble (and their terms and conditions for it were almost exploitative) and, to date, no bonuses have been awarded me (except the normal 'Best Odds').But the range of availability of events (especially for Soccer) is wide and they don't seem to mind putting up odds that are pulled about all over the place by punters when they appear to get prices wrong.All in all, they have been a fair Company.As with all my reviews, if anything changes, I will append this review with further experiences.\",\n",

You can bet as low as 0.10 cents unlike Bwin for example which the betting  minimum is 0.50 cents and you know why? Bwin has over 200 betting options per game. There is no Home/Away no bet for example in bet365. Team to win with over/under goals betting option is also very very limited in bet365. Now the worse. I\\'m almost sure that they do this on purpose. On every single betting website in this earth whenever you lose a bet that bet gets down marked ,red marked/ or explicitly says that you have lost it right? But not with bet365 . You have a coupon with 14 games and you will not know if you actually lost those games unless you are following every single game result.

And they give you 2. 100% matched bonus and you even get to keep the bonus money after its wagered. Other sites try and copy but remove the matched bonus and only give you the winnings to be wagered. Then they give you a loyalty bonus now and again which I haven't had from any other site. The best though is the risk free bet they offer regularly that nobody else does. £50 risk free bet and if you lose it's withdrawable. Name 1 site that does that? Like I said there's a REASON why these guys are number 1 and I feel privileged betting with Bet365.\",\n",

They are very rude and try to terminate the chat as soon as they can the say go read our rules on most of the chat they constantly using auto script (which is fine if that script was relevant to the issue which is is not) and dont take a look at the issue itself becuase its easier to quote go read the rules, when they are rude and you ask to speak to a manager they say \"this does not need to be escalated \" and then either terminate the chat or tell u to email in . From my experience i would use another betting site as its gone from bad to worse over the past year or so and will only get worse as the management do not care how there customer service team are speaking to the customers.',\n",

Hmmm...makes you think, doesn't it? Or, at least, it should. The truth is that this casino is really a crapino. An absolute farce. Whoever, or perhaps whatever, happens to be behind this site is both rotting & rotten to the core. To lose is one thing but just listen to this. I covered the whole roulette board but for one space, the number 29. Guess what number came up, you got it, 29! I tried again, number 11 uncovered, what number came up? Yip number 11! A con is a con is a con and a fool is a fool is a fool. Take heed. There are honest websites but I will not name them here. I am not a tout nor am I affiliated with any gambling websites but it galls me when scurrilous slime get away with robbing hard earned money from decent people. I am not naive. I understand the risk involved in games of chance but when the game is so blatantly rigged against the punter one can fairly say that chance has been tampered with. If you are considering signing up to this crapino do yourself a favour, don't. Avoid  this terrible experience. If you are one of the unluckies who have already joined, my commiserations; however, if you miraculously still have some money in this crapino take it out now, this minute,  while you still have it. Otherwise, believe me, it will be robbed. The only way to have a positive experience at this crapino is if you are dead; or if you happen to be one of the freakily ghoulish 3 amigos who can dissappear at will, lol. What a joke !The only comment I can make in favour of this crapino is that it is more honest than Virgin Games and that's not saying anything really as it would be impossible to be less honest than Virgin Games. °For more details on this see my review of Virgin Games.

If there have been issues, it was never as a consequence of Bet365, as a matter of fact, they would email or call, to alert you and resolve it in a courteous and professional manner to my benefit! I've been using them since 2004, elsewhere I've had all sorts of issues with all my accounts, and as the years have gone by, I have reduced my betting habits to a select 3 and Bet365 is my number 1. Almost all of us who bet have had issues with this and that, consequently, what matters is how the customer services resolve problems and address feedback. In my mind the main thing that sticks out over the years is the excellent customer services and management team at Bet365. Issues are eventually resolved with pragmatism, they are not averse to civil reasoning, consequently, retention of my loyal custom is subject to my proviso that they continue to provide excellence at the point of delivery and if standards fall below my expectations as a Bet365 customer, problems are eventually, if not from the point of contact, resolved.Quite frankly, Bet365 are the John Lewis of bookies, excellent product, site the best, customer services the best, 8/10.

I lost my cash out option on a £300 bet from around the 68th minute of a 90 minute football match.  I was up to around £480 at one point and was balancing the cash out with another bet I had running (corner count), monitoring both to make sure I didn't drop below the initial £500 wager.  Well what happened was disgusting, they froze all cash outs on my game, locking up over £600 of live bets right through to the end of the game.  I will be more careful with them from now on - luckily one bet came in and I only lost £25 but I would have cashed out the other bet when it dropped back down to my original £300 outlay (on that bet). They take cash outs away whenever they feel like it.  I changed brosers, wifi and 4G and even tried my laptop and still it was frozen.  It was clearly deliberate, yet they pride themselves on this cash out option.  Unfortunately it appeared I was winning so they locked this down and made sure I couldn't reach my money anymore.  Ridiculous company built on bad morals to victimise the gullible.  If you start winning they WILL make sure you dont, house always wins people and this is a perfect example of pure greed from a business who has no intention of making it a fair playing field.  They need to be shut down or regulated heavily.  These cash outs should be available in the same context as they are will smaller bets being placed. You can usually cash out right through to the 87th-89th minute, why should they be allowed to dictate a different playing field just because the stakes are higher?  It should be the same rule for every bet - this is pure greed.  Yes my other bet of over 2.5 goals nearly came in and would have landed £660 from the £300 bet, but the fact is they locked it down pretty much minutes after the second goal hit the net.  Its not on, I could have cashed out and walked away in profit right through to around the 75th-78th minute.  I for one will not be using them ever again.  RegardsBrendan\",\n",

It is without doubt the best site, gives what it offers and if you are a horse backer as I am, gives unequaled guaranteed odds service.It even allows the punter to take overnight odds which if they then become greater, they pay out at the better odds, they have few rules and even allow popular bets like lucky15, 31 et. to be settled at the greater odds, unlike Betfred which hides behind small print to deny greater payouts. For the horse punter there is no better site. As for cashout, who in their right minds makes a bet and then bottles out half way through? These \"advantages\" that all sites now offer will always settle at a fraction of the total due and suspensions will always happen when a team, in football for instance has a penalty or dangerous free kick.

I mainly play the Roulette there and without much difficulty I have been able to cash out winnings twice. The site has a nice design, it's fairly easy to understand the rules of the bonuses, and the money is delivered when you uphold the rules. Granted, I haven't tried to cash out a higher winning than 75 euro, but then again, I wouldn't like to play with too much money in casinos in general. When you wish to cash out money for the first time, the site asks for documentation, either drivers licence, passport or national ID card, which most sites apparently do. I uploaded a photo of my drivers licence and a couple of days later it had been accepted. My winnings were then transferred to my bank account without any problems about a week later. The second time I cashed out my winnings, the money were transferred only 2 days later without me having to upload anything again. I cannot speak on behalf of all the people who feel they've been cheated by the site, but only give in my own input: read the rules of the bonuses, only insert the type of money you can afford to lose, and don't panic if you don't get your money or service right away - it's an international site after all.  Great site if you ask me, and I know that I'll use it again.\",\n",

Still no free bet. Finally, after a 30 min live chat, I was told that my account was in fact restricted because I had \"won too many times\" - actual quote from CSR and that it had been so for a month. Apparently, they just \"forgot\" to email me. Had I known that before, I would have bet my money somewhere else with better odds and gotten better returns. TLDR: they are only pretending to offer you 80 min insurance so that you\\'ll bet with them at their crappy odds. If you lose your bet after the 80th minute more than 3 times (because apparently that\\'s in your control), they will claim you weren\\'t eligible for insurance all along.

They allowed my Son to create an account in my name in April 2018 but he has used his bank card to deposit funds. They have failed to do the relevant security checks and not asked for any documentation to prove it was me setting up the account (which it clearly wasn't).Up to October they have allowed him to deposit over £1900 without ever asking for documents to prove Identification. How can a company operate like this? - I tell you why because Betting Companies are the scum of the earth who only care about profit and greed....Not the lives they are ruining and fundamentally the people they are killing!My son had previously self-banned himself from all gambling sites to prevent this and has made tremendous progress but unfortunately has used this account when suffering with depression and also the loss of my mother last month. Whilst I am annoyed and very disappointed in him I appreciate he has a problem and an addiction to which he is struggling along with.I have sent an email with my husband to their customer services team and had no response....very disappointed but not surprised! - I am also not surprised that they only ask people for Identification when they are trying to withdraw funds. How can a company have double standards where they allow you to deposit £1900 without ID but not withdraw £1900 without ID? - They also allowed my son (pretending to be me) to bet £800 in one 24 hours sitting....why wouldn't this raise alarms? And finally they also allowed my son to create the account in MY NAME but using HIS EMAIL ADDRESS......How many alarm bells/warnings do you want?!?! - THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT PEOPLE STRUGGLING.I will be escalating this situation to the Financial Conduct Authority as I have no doubts that they haven't acted in the best interests of those struggling with addiction and to protect other people's identity.\",\n",

However a staff member from 10bet told me to upload it to the site as it will be clearer will have a better quality. I then re-uploaded it using the website's system and even uploaded another picture of my face with my passport (a clearer picture) to make sure the details are visible. I have double checked with with a 10bet staff and they told me that the picture is fine. I have also done a phone verification from 10bet team and I have even asked if further verification is needed, they said there isnt a need of verification as i have done all of them.it was stated that there was betting collusion going on in my account, and accused me of cooperating with other gamblers to place the bet. In other words, Cheating. I clearly was not involved in any form of fraudulent pattern with 10bet or even any other betting accounts. I thought it was a mistake by 10bet at first as I clearly is not involved in any form of betting collusion and called up 10bet regarding this matter. The customer service was not helpful as he did not give me any form of proof to it.I have even confirmed everything with the live chat, email and through phone call. Non of the 10bet staffs stated that there is a problem with my account. I have also confirmed by one of the 10bet staff members that my money will be with my shortly as it has been over 2 weeks of reviewing my account. Furthermore, I have not receive any notice that there has been betting collusion or any breach of terms and conditions from 10bet. Everything went just fine and at most times I will go on live chat to ask and to make sure I do not breach any form of terms and conditions. I have waited almost 3 weeks for my money, and chased 10bet via live chat ,email and through phone line (customer service) and all of the sudden my account has been closed.I hope this can be reviewed again as it is very unfair to me as a 10bet player.\",\n",

If you request a withdrawal before meeting their rollover requirements, you forfeit your money. Understand the turnover requirements - I had a £200 bonus so had to place 30 bets at £100 as a minimum.Speak with the customer service team if you need help or advice on remaining wagering requirements. They are very helpful and honest. Provide your documentation early - eg upon signup as they will ask you for Photo ID, Bank Statements, Utility Bill, Copy of front and back of card. This can take a few days to review - I would suggest following up with customer services if you do not get a reply email.They do pay out and I was lucky enough to win over £3000 and they paid this after 5 business days. I will say they are slow and customer service are not very good in keeping you informed as they have no access to the finance departments - I really did worry about if they would pay after reviewing comments on this website. However they clearly state on the website 3 to 5 business days and did pay up.DO NOT SIGN UP if you have issues with your identification process, eg you have no photo ID or Utility bill, they will not pay out. DO NOT SIGN UP if you have duplicate accounts with them, they will close you down and you will lose your money. DO NOT SIGN UP unless you have read and understood the terms. DO NOT WITHDRAW unless you have met the wagering requirements. This is by far the hardest bookie I have ever bet with, however they did PAY OUT - so good luck.',\n",
